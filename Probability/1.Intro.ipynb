    "## What is Probability?\n",
    "Probability is a mathematical subject which enables us in determining or predicting how likely it is that an event will happen. The probability of occurrence is assigned a value from 0 to 1. When the value assigned is 1, it implies that the event will happen with all certainty. On the other hand when it is 0, it implies that the event will never take place. Thus, we can be more certain of an event's occurrence when its probability is higher.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## What is Statistics?\n",
    "Statistics is another mathematical subject which deals primarily with data. It helps us draw inferences from data by having procedures in place for collecting, classifying and presenting the data in an organized manner. The analysis and interpretation of the refined data helps in providing further insights.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Role of probability, statistics and computation in data science\n",
    "When studying and exploring an event, we make use of probability to quantify how likely it is that an event will occur. On the other hand, we use statistics to observe patterns in data samples to draw inferences about a population. We must note that statistics is not completely independent of probability, as statistical analysis involves probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since, both statistics and probability have their roots in mathematics, computation as a tool is needed to perform quantitative analysis. The use of computers is also necessary to perform complex calculations while processing the statistical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Linear Algebra?\n",
    "Linear Algebra is a mathematical subject the deals with the theory of systems of linear equations, matrices, vector spaces and linear transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Why Linear Algebra?\n",
    "Linear Algebra is critically used in almost all peripheries of science, practically solving most of the problems using linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the complex science problems are converted into problems of vectors and matrices and then solving it with linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of data (especially, big data), linear algebra can be very handy to process huge chunks of data to accomplish many practical transformations such as graphical transformations, face morphing, object detection and tracking, audio and image compression, edge detection, blurring, and signal processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Role of linear algebra in data science\n",
    "While solving a given business problem, an appropriate statistical computing technique may be used. These algorithms while working on the data, may either use iterative methods or  linear algebra techniques for computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Algebra works as a computational engine for most of the data science problems because of its performance advantages over iterative methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Iterative methods vs Linear Algebra techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we need to find the Frobenius norm of a matrix(mat1).  We can do this using either the iterative method or the linear algebra technique, as shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](1_a.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe that the linear algebra technique is much more efficient than the iterative method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some places where linear algebra is used:\n",
    "1. Message Transmission with encryption\n",
    "2. Solving an electrical network\n",
    "3. Finding relationships on a social networking site\n",
    "\n",

    "## Machine Learning\n",

    "\n",
    "### Supervised machine learning model: Types\n",
    "There can be two types of supervised machine learning techniques as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classification: Used to predict discrete results. \n",
    "For example, assume a company wants to predict the budget period of a new project that they have acquired as short-term/long-term, based on various input attributes about the project such as number of resources required, software requirement, hardware requirement etc., then we use the classification technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regression: Used to predict continuous numeric results\n",
    "For example, if we are trying to predict the approximate budget requirement of a new project that the company has acquired in actual quantifiable figures, based on various input attributes about the project such as number of resources required, software requirement, hardware requirement etc., then we use the regression technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised machine learning model: Summary\n",
    "We can summarize our learning of the unsupervised machine learning as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the first step, we fix some variables or parameters based on which the machine will arrange the given data (in our example, we have taken \"color\" as the parameter).\n",
    "- In the second step, the machine groups similar data points together. In our example, fruits with the same color are grouped together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semi-supervised machine learning\n",
    "In real-time, it may so happen that the unlabeled data points exceed the number of labeled data points in a data set. In order to fit a model to such data we use the semi-supervised machine learning technique, wherein we perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Train the model with labeled data points only.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 2: Use the above model to predict the labels of the unlabeled data points\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 3: Combine the existing labeled data points with the newly labeled data points and use it to retrain the model\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 4: Repeat the 2nd and 3rd steps until it converges\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of semi-supervised learning are text processing, video-indexing, bioinformatics, web page classification and news classification among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement learning\n",
    "Reinforcement machine learning algorithm is a reward based and immediate feedback technique. Here the machine's goal is to maximize the numerical reward at each and every step. In the process of learning, the machine is not provided any supervision as opposed to the previous ML algorithms we discussed till now. Instead the machine is expected to figure out the optimum actions which will reap the maximum reward at each step, all on their own, without any interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actions that the machine takes at each step might not only affect the immediate reward but may also affect all the subsequent rewards. The ultimate aim is to reach the max possible reward in the least amount of steps possible.Thus, trial and error search methodology and immediate feedback in the form of a numerical reward are the two main characteristics of reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of reinforcement learning would be when a machine learning to play chess decides whether a move is right by planning the possible moves, anticipating the corresponding counter moves and finally choosing one based on reward based appeal for a particular position or set of moves. Another example could be when a trash collecting bot's charge is about to reach critical levels and it needs to make a decision, to clean one more room before reaching out for the charging station or to immediately rush to the nearest charging station. The decision taken by the bot depends on the ease with which it can reach the charging station, based on its prior knowledge.\n",
