    "The limitation of 2 sample t test is that it can compare only two treatments at a time. Thus when we have  more than two samples to compare, we need to perform multiple t tests.\n",

    "    \n",
    "- __Increase in probability of Type 1 Error:__ Another drawback with performing multiple t tests is the increase in probability of type 1 error. If we perform one t test with 0.05 level of significance then it means there is 5% of probability of getting a type 1 error, which means the probability of the test being accurate is 95% or 0.95.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If we conduct 3 independent 3 tests, the probability of the test producing correct result will be $(0.95)*(0.95)*(0.95) = 0.857$  \n",

    "\n",
    "The surveying agency compared the performance of three teachers based on the mark scored by students who have studied under them by performing One way ANOVA. Here the __dependent variable mark is quantitative__ in nature and there is __only one independent variable__ i.e. teacher which is __categorical__ nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the agency wants to know if there are any other factors that affect the performance of students.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The agency notices that out of the 18 students who are picked 9 are male and 9 are female. The agency is interested to find out whether there is a significant difference between the performance of male students and female students. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a significant difference between the performance of male and female students, the dependent variable mark is affected by two factors, i.e., teacher and gender. When there are __two factors__ that affect the population and both the factors are __categorical__ in nature, we have to perform __two way ANOVA__.  \n",

    "The agency performs two way ANOVA to find out the combined effect of teacher and gender on the performance of students. "
