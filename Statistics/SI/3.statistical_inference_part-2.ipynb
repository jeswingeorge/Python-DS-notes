    "Parameters are descriptive measures of an entire population. Estimating the population parameter and error associated with it is one of the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter estimation includes two major techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Point estimation:__ This involves finding a single, most likely value of a parameter. Single value is calculated which may be the best estimate of the parameter. \n",
    "- __Interval estimation (confidence interval):__ This involves finding an interval in which the parameter may lie. A confidence level is associated with every confidence interval which suggests the degrees of certainty with which the population parameter lies in the confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters to be estimated by the agency\n",
    "\n",
    "The surveying agency has to find out the point estimates as well as the confidence interval for various population parameters:  \n",
    "1. Estimating the population mean: This includes\n",
    "    - finding the point estimate for the population mean\n",
    "    - finding the confidence interval for the population mean\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Estimating the population variance/standard deviation: This includes \n",
    "    - finding the point estimate for the standard deviation and population variance\n",
    "    - finding the confidence interval for the standard deviation and population variance\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Challenge 3.1: Estimating population mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Surveying agency starts with estimating the population mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "As already discussed, estimating population mean includes\n",
    "- finding the __point estimate of population mean__ i.e. finding the mean marks scored in the surprise test, considering all the students in the country would have appeared for the surprise test\n",
    "- finding the __confidence interval of population mean with 95% confidence level__ i.e. finding an interval such that mean marks scored by all the students in the country falls in the interval with 95% probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first find out how the surveying agency finds the point estimate of population mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "Point estimate of population mean needs to be calculated in order to estimate population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be done in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 1:__ The agency has to identify a sample statistic that closely represents the population mean. The sample statistic is called __estimator__ of the population parameter and its value  is called the __estimate__ of population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 2:__ After finding the estimator, the agency has to check the quality of the estimator. One of the commonly used measure of the quality is the __unbiasedness of the estimator__. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we calculate the expected value of the estimator. Bias of this estimator is the different between this calculated value and the actual value of the parameter (being estimated). Hence, when this difference is zero, estimator is said to be unbiased. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the agency figures out the estimator and verifies its unbiasedness, the estimator is the unbiased estimator of the population parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "While performing step 1, there are various methods to find out a sample statistic that closely represents the population parameter. One such method is method of __maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)__. \n",
    "\n",
    "The surveying agency decides to use method of maximum likelihood estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Maximum Likelihood Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is one of the methods of estimating the (population) parameters of a statistical model from given data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Maximum likelihood estimation deals with finding the likelihood function depending on the model that the data follows and finding the condition under which the likelihood function attains the maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The surveying agency is analyzing the attribute mark which is normally distributed.Thus, the agency has to find the condition in which the likelihood function for normally distributed data attains the maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let us try to find out the likelihood function for the normally distributed variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Likelihood function for a normally distributed variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability density function (PDF) for a given data model denoted as f(x|θ), specifies the probability of observing a data vector x, given the population parameter θ.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the likelihood function for a given data model, denoted as L(θ|x) gives the likelihood of observing population parameter θ, given the data vector x. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we use probability density function to calculate the probability of occurrence of the observed data vector x when __population parameter θ is known__ and we use __likelihood function__ to find out the likelihood of the unknown population parameter θ when series of observations x or sample is given. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](3_like.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Maximum likelihood estimate of population mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Method of maximum likelihood estimation deals with finding the condition in which likelihood function L(θ|x) attains maximum value. The value of population parameter θ in that condition is called __maximum likelihood estimate__ of θ.\n",
    "\n",
    "The surveying agency is dealing with the marks scored by students in the surprise test which is normally distributed. It finds the maximum likelihood estimate of population mean μ by finding the condition under which the likelihood function for normal distribution attains maximum value and by finding the value of μ under that condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Maximum likelihood estimator of population mean\n",

    "##### Unbiased estimator of population mean\n",
    "\n",
    "As already discussed, finding point estimator of population mean involves two steps i.e. \n",
    "- finding the maximum likelihood estimator of population mean\n",
    "- verifying the unbiasedness of the maximum likelihood estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "The surveying agency has found that sample mean is the maximum likelihood estimator of population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the agency has to verify whether sample mean is the unbiased estimator of population mean. The same can be verified by finding the expected value of sample mean. If the expected value of sample mean is equal to the parameter being estimated i.e. population mean, then the agency would conclude that sample mean is an unbiased estimator of population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](3_unbias.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Point estimate of population mean\n",
    "\n",
    "The surveying agency found that the best estimation of population mean is got from the sample mean ( X ). It also verified that this estimator is unbiased.\n",
    "\n",
    "The surveying agency has already calculated the sample mean i.e. the mean marks scored by the 1120 students in the surprise test, to be 413.2759. The population mean value can be estimated by this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, if in this country all students had taken this surprise test, the mean marks scored would be around 413.2759.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Interval estimate of population mean\n",
    "\n",
    "The surveying agency has found that sample mean is the point estimator of population mean. The sample mean was calculated to be 413.2759, which is used to estimate the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the sample mean may have a different value if the agency would have chosen a different sample. This suggests the sample mean varies as the sample changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the agency would have chosen multiple samples of 1120 students across the country and then for each samples, if they would have calculated the sample mean, it would have found a range of values for the sample mean.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, instead of specifying a single value of sample mean as the point estimate of population mean, the agency may choose to specify this range of values of sample mean for estimating population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of estimation technique is called __interval estimation__ and the range/interval is called the __confidence interval__.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Confidence interval\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, a confidence interval (CI) is a type of interval estimate of a population parameter. It is an observed interval, that frequently includes the unknown value of the parameter of interest, if the experiment is repeated. How frequently the observed interval contains the parameter is determined by the confidence level associated with the confidence interval. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, that the surveying agency decided to set the confidence level at 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we need to find a __range of sample means__ such that the population mean falls within the range with 95% probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Confidence interval of population mean\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed, confidence interval of population mean is nothing but a range of values of sample mean, within which the population mean is expected to lie. The range is identified by analyzing multiple samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a population of size N, if all possible samples of size n are selected:\n",
    "- sample mean is calculated for each sample\n",
    "- the frequency distribution of the sample means is plotted\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting distribution is called sampling distribution of sample mean for sample size or sampling distribution of mean. Note that - \n",
    "- each point on the sampling distribution of mean curve represents a sample mean\n",
    "- the area under the sampling distribution curve represents the probability of finding a particular sample mean \n",
    "\n",
    "__Therefore, finding the confidence interval for population mean with a confidence level of 95% is about finding the interval under which 95% of the total area under the sampling distribution of mean curve lies.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in order to find the confidence interval of population mean, one must plot the sampling distribution of mean, which is the frequency distribution of all possible sample means of a particular sample size.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the surveying agency has only one sample and hence only one sample mean. Moreover, it is not feasible for the surveying agency to analyze all possible samples because of the huge population size and the complexity involved in conducting surprise test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question that arises at this point is, how would the agency plot the sampling distribution of mean, by analyzing only one sample. We need to understand some of the properties of sampling distribution of mean to find the answer to this question. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sampling distribution of mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider a simple example to understand sampling distribution of sample mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "A die (having six faces marked from 1 to 6) is thrown 4 times and the observed outputs are 2,5,3 and 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider the set of these 4 numbers as our population and calculate the mean,\n",
    "\n",
    "The population mean (μ) = (2+5+3+6)/4 = 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's choose all possible samples of size 2 and calculate the sample means for each of the samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "The samples and the sample means are listed in the table below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](3_sm.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sampling distribution of mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us plot the frequency distribution of all the sample means above.\n"
