    "__Two Way ANOVA__ is also known as __Randomized Block Design__\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is an extension of the one-way ANOVA that examines the influence of two different categorical independent variables on one continuous dependent variable. It compares the mean differences between groups that have been split on two independent variables (called factors).\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions  \n",
    "- The populations from which the samples were obtained must be normally or approximately normally distributed\n",
    "- The samples must be independent\n",
    "- The variances of the populations must be equal\n",
    "- The groups must have the same sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two way ANOVA - Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Two way ANOVA is performed to analyze the effect of two categorical independent variables on the dependent variable which is quantitative in nature. \n",
    "\n",
    "By performing two way ANOVA we can find out the following:\n",
    "- Effect of 1st independent variable on the dependent variable. \n",
    "- Effect of 2nd independent variable on the dependent variable.\n",
    "- Combined effect of both the independent variables on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By performing two way ANOVA the surveying agency finds out:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How the performance of a student is affected by the teacher under whom he/she has studied.\n",
    "- Does gender of a student has a significant effect on his performance.\n",
    "- How the attributes teacher and gender together affect the performance of a student. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Two way ANOVA - The data to be analyzed\n",
    "\n",
    "The mark scored by the 15 students along with the gender and the teacher under which they studied is given below. The agency analyzes this data to find the effect of teacher, gender and the combination of both on the performance of students.\n",
