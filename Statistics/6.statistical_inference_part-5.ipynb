    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we have seen how to estimate the difference between two population means. The surveying agency estimated the difference between the population means of two different schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can say that, __school__ is the factor that distinguished both the populations from each other. School is a categorical attribute which had two different levels i.e. ST1S1 and ST1S3 for the two populations that the agency analyzed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In inferential statistics, we often deal with such factors which are __categorical__ in nature, having multiple levels that distinguish multiple populations from each other. These levels are called __treatments__. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find out whether a factor has significant effect on the population, we need to __compare these treatments.__\n",
    "\n",
    "For example in order to find whether school as a factor affects the performance of students or not, the surveying agency may compare the performance of students from two different schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections we will learn about statistical inference techniques that are used to compare multiple treatments. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge 6.1: Does school affect the performance of students?\n",
    "\n",
    "For doing so the agency compares the performance of students from two different schools ST1S1 and ST1S3. In this section the agency determines whether the difference in population means is significant enough to conclude that school as a factor affects the performance of students. \n",
    "\n",
    "While determining the effect of a factor on two different populations, by analyzing two samples we may use a special kind of hypothesis test which is called 2 sample t test. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us know more about __2 sample t test.__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __2 sample t test__ is a hypothesis test, performed to find out whether there is a significant difference between two population means by analyzing samples drawn from each population. \n",
    "\n",
    "This test works best when:\n",
    "- we are dealing with small samples, which are drawn from normally distributed populations. However, it can also be used while dealing with larger samples. \n",
    "- the assumption of normality is violated but only if the underlying distribution is not highly skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The surveying agency is comparing the marks scored by students of the school ST1S1 and ST1S3. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find out whether the difference in the population means is statistically significant with a significance level of 0.05, the agency performs 2 sample t-test. \n",
    "\n",
    "The agency is dealing with small samples and it has already verified the underlying distribution of mark to be normal distribution. Hence the assumptions for 2 sample t test are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, both the samples are drawn from independent populations. Thus the surveying agency performs __2 sample t test for independent samples__ in order to determine whether the difference in population means is statistically significant.\n",

    "As the null hypothesis states the population means to be the same i.e μ1= μ2, the mean of the sampling distribution will be at $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0$.\n",
