    "__Parallel processing__ is a mode of operation where the task is executed simultaneously in multiple processors in the same computer. It is meant to reduce the overall processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is usually a bit of overhead when communicating between processes which can actually increase the overall time taken for small tasks instead of decreasing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, the __multiprocessing__ module is used to run independent parallel processes by using subprocesses (instead of threads). It allows you to leverage multiple processors on a machine (both Windows and Unix), which means, the processes can be run in completely separate memory locations.\n",

    "In parallel processing, there are two types of execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A __Synchronous execution__ is one the processes are completed in the same order in which it was started. This is achieved by locking the main program until the respective processes are finished.\n",

    "        - `Pool.map()` and `Pool.starmap()`\n",

    "## 1. How to parallelize any function?\n",
    "\n",
    "The general way to parallelize any operation is to take a particular function that should be run multiple times and make it run parallelly in different processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you initialize a `Pool` with n number of processors and pass the function you want to parallelize to one of Pools parallization methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "`multiprocessing.Pool()` provides the `apply()`, `map()` and `starmap()` methods to make any function run in parallel.\n",

    "\n",
    "Both `apply` and `map` take the function to be parallelized as the main argument. But the difference is, `apply()` takes an args argument that accepts the parameters passed to the ‘function-to-be-parallelized’ as an argument, whereas, map can take only one iterable as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, `map()` is really more suitable for simpler iterable operations but does the job faster.\n",
