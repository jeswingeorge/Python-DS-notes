# Static

## Problem statement

Let us assume that in our online shopping app, we want to provide a limited 50% flat off on all mobile phones.

How can we write our code so that all mobile objects get a 50% off? One solution is to create a discount attribute and hard code the value as 50% as shown below:

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self, price, brand):
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand
        self.discount = 50

    def purchase(self):
        total = self.price - self.price * self.discount / 100
        print (self.brand, "mobile with price", self.price, "is available after discount at", total)

mob1=Mobile(20000, "Apple")
mob2=Mobile(30000, "Apple")
mob3=Mobile(5000, "Samsung")

mob1.purchase()
mob2.purchase()

```

Output:

Apple mobile with price 20000 is available after discount at 10000.0
Apple mobile with price 30000 is available after discount at 15000.0

However, the solution of hardcoding the value in the attribute is not a good one. For example, since this is a limited time discount we should be able to programmatically enable and disable the discount using functions like this:

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self, price, brand):
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand
        self.discount = 0
    def purchase(self):
        total = self.price - self.price * self.discount / 100
        print (self.brand, "mobile with price", self.price, "is available after discount at", total)


def enable_discount(list_of_mobiles):
    for mobile in list_of_mobiles:
        mobile.discount=50

def disable_discount(list_of_mobiles):
    for mobile in list_of_mobiles:
        mobile.discount=0

mob1=Mobile(20000, "Apple")
mob2=Mobile(30000, "Apple")
mob3=Mobile(5000, "Samsung")
mob4=Mobile(6000, "Samsung")

list_of_mobiles=[mob1,mob2,mob3,mob4]
mob1.purchase()

enable_discount(list_of_mobiles)
mob2.purchase()
mob3.purchase()

disable_discount(list_of_mobiles)
mob4.purchase()

```

However, in our current approach, each object has discount as an attribute. If we change the value for one object, it does not affect the other object. If we have to change, we have to change for all the objects, one by one.

What we need is a way to make an attribute shared across objects. The data is shared by all objects, not owned by each object. Thus, by making a single change, it should reflect in all objects at one go. 


![](images\24.PNG)

We can create shared attributes by placing them directly inside the class and not inside the constructor. And since this attribute is not owned by any one object, we don’t need the self to create this attribute. Such variables which are created at a class level are called __static variables__. In below code discount is a static value.

```
class Mobile:
    discount = 50
    def __init__(self, price, brand):
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand

```

Now that we have created static variables, we can access them using the Class name itself. Static variable belong to the class and not an object. Hence we don’t need self to access static variables.

```
class Mobile:
    discount = 50
    def __init__(self, price, brand):
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand

    def purchase(self):
        total = self.price - self.price * Mobile.discount / 100
        print (self.brand, "mobile with price", self.price, "is available after discount at", total)

mob1=Mobile(20000, "Apple")
mob2=Mobile(30000, "Apple")
mob3=Mobile(5000, "Samsung")

mob1.purchase()
mob2.purchase()
mob3.purchase()
```

Output:

Apple mobile with price 20000 is available after discount at 10000.0
Apple mobile with price 30000 is available after discount at 15000.0
Samsung mobile with price 5000 is available after discount at 2500.0

### Updating Static Variables

We can update the static value using the class name.

```
class Mobile:
    discount = 50
    def __init__(self, price, brand):
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand

    def purchase(self):
        total = self.price - self.price * Mobile.discount / 100
        print (self.brand, "mobile with price", self.price, "is available after discount at", total)

def enable_discount():
    Mobile.discount = 50

def disable_discount():
    Mobile.discount = 0

mob1=Mobile(20000, "Apple")
mob2=Mobile(30000, "Apple")
mob3=Mobile(5000, "Samsung")

enable_discount()
mob1.purchase()
mob2.purchase()
disable_discount()
mob3.purchase()

```

### Static vs Reference Variables

Static variables belong to the class and hence it is incorrect to access them or update them using the reference variable or self. Doing so may cause unexpected consequences in the code and should be refrained from. 

### Static Variables & Encapsulation

We can make our static variable as a private variable by adding a double underscore in front of it. We can also create getter and setter methods to access or modify it.

```
class Mobile:
    __discount = 50

    def get_discount(self):
        return Mobile.__discount

    def set_discount(self,discount):
        Mobile.__discount = discount

m1=Mobile()
print(m1.get_discount())
```

### Need for Static Methods

In the below code we are invoking the getter method using a reference variable. But the self is not used inside the method at all.

```
class Mobile:
    __discount = 50
    def __init__(self, price, brand):
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand

    def purchase(self):
        total = self.price - self.price * Mobile.__discount / 100
        print ("Total is ",total)

    def get_discount(self):
        return Mobile.__discount

    def set_discount(self,discount):
        Mobile.__discount = discount

mob1=Mobile(20000, "Apple")
mob2=Mobile(30000, "Apple")
mob3=Mobile(5000, "Samsung")

print(mob1.get_discount())

```

## Static Methods - Introduction

Since static variable is object independent, we need a way to access the getter setter methods without an object. This is possible by creating static methods. Static methods are those methods which can be accessed without an object. They are accessed using the class name.

There are two rules in creating such static methods:
- The methods should not have self
- @staticmethod must be written on top of it


```
@staticmethod
def get_discount():
    return Mobile.__discount
@staticmethod
def set_discount(discount):
    Mobile.__discount=discount

```

### Accessing Static Methods

We can access static methods directly using the class name, even without creating objects.

```
class Mobile:
    __discount = 50
    def __init__(self, price, brand):
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand

    def purchase(self):
        total = self.price - self.price * Mobile.__discount / 100
        print ("Total is ",total)

    @staticmethod
    def get_discount():
        return Mobile.__discount

    @staticmethod
    def set_discount(discount):
        Mobile.__discount = discount

print (Mobile.get_discount())

```

Output:

50

### Mega Sale - The Complete Solution

```
class Mobile:
    __discount = 50
    def __init__(self, price, brand):
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand

    def purchase(self):
        total = self.price - self.price * Mobile.__discount / 100
        print (self.brand, "mobile with price", self.price, "is available after discount at", total)

    @staticmethod
    def enable_discount():
        Mobile.set_discount(50)

    @staticmethod
    def disable_discount():
        Mobile.set_discount(0)

    @staticmethod
    def get_discount():
        return Mobile.__discount

    @staticmethod
    def set_discount(discount):
        Mobile.__discount = discount

mob1=Mobile(20000, "Apple")
mob2=Mobile(30000, "Apple")
mob3=Mobile(5000, "Samsung")

Mobile.disable_discount()

mob1.purchase()

Mobile.enable_discount()

mob2.purchase()

Mobile.disable_discount()

mob3.purchase()
                                                    
```

Output:

Apple mobile with price 20000 is available after discount at 20000.0
Apple mobile with price 30000 is available after discount at 15000.0
Samsung mobile with price 5000 is available after discount at 5000.0

### Static Counter

Let us say we want to assign a unique number to each mobile object. The first object should be given a number 1000 and subsequent objects should have that value increased by 1. We can accomplish this by using a combination of static and instance variables as shown below:

```
class Mobile:
    counter = 1000
    def __init__(self, price, brand):
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand
        self.mobile_id = Mobile.counter
        Mobile.counter += 1

mob1=Mobile(20000, "Apple")
mob2=Mobile(30000, "Apple")
mob3=Mobile(5000, "Samsung")

print("mobile_id for mob1 is", mob1.mobile_id)
print("mobile_id for mob2 is", mob2.mobile_id)
print("mobile_id for mob3 is", mob3.mobile_id)

print("Current value of counter is", Mobile.counter)

```

Output:

mobile_id for mob1 is 1000
mobile_id for mob2 is 1001
mobile_id for mob3 is 1002
Current value of counter is 1003

### Static - Summary

- Static attributes are created at class level.
- Static attributes are accessed using ClassName.
- Static attributes are object independent. We can access them without creating instance (object) of the class in which they are defined.
- The value stored in static attribute is shared between all instances(objects) of the class in which the static attribute is defined.

### NOTE

#### Appendix: Static and Reference Variable - Try out

Even though we can use reference variables to access static values, if we are not careful, we may end up making mistakes which are hard to notice as shown in the below code

```
class Mobile:
    discount=50
    def display(self):
        print(self.discount)
         #The above line is valid way of accessing static
        print(Mobile.discount)

    def change(self):
        self.discount=40
        #The above line creates a new attribute
        #instead of modifying the static value
        #Now there are two discount variables,
        #one at class level and the other at object level
        #Hence best is to access Static through class name

m1=Mobile()
m1.display()#Will display 50 and 50

m1.change()
m1.display()#Will display 40 and 50

```

Output:

50
50
40
50
