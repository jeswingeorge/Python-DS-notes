# Class & Object

## Class & Object

Objects are real world entities. Anything you can describe in this world is an object. Classes on the other hand are not real. They are just a concept. Class is a short form of Classification. A class is a classification of certain objects and it is just a description of the properties and behavior all objects of that classification should possess.

Class is a like a recipe and the object is like the cupcake we bake using it. All cupcakes created from a recipe share similar characteristics like shape, sweetness, etc. But they are all unique as well. One cupcake may have strawberry frosting while another might have vanilla. Similarly, objects of a class share similar characteristics but they differ in their values for those characteristics.

#### What does a class contain?

What does a recipe contain? It contains list of ingredients which make up the cake and the directions. Similarly, a class contains the properties/attributes of the object and the operations/behavior that can be performed on an object. 

![](images\5.PNG)

Consider the below object:  
Will you classify it as a Mobile or a Shoe? Discuss your answer.

![](images\6.PNG)

This is because the object has price and brand and we have defined that all objects which have a price and brand are considered to belong to the Mobile classification. This object cannot be classified as a shoe because it does not have a material property.

Thus we can say that this object is an example of or instance of the Mobile classification. Under this classification, there can be many objects and the object shown above is an instance of or example of it.

## Class, Object & Reference Variable Creation

#### How to define a class?

A class is defined using the class keyword in python. For example, the below code creates a class called Mobile without any attributes or behavior.

```
class Mobile:
    pass
```

#### How to create objects?

To create an object, we need a class. The syntax for creating an object is "<classname>()", where <classname> is the name of the class.

For example, the below code creates three Mobile objects:

```
Mobile()
Mobile()
Mobile()
```

#### Accessing values

Is the below a valid piece of code?
```
10
10
10
```
Yes. We are just creating 3 values in three lines without storing them in any variable and hence we cannot access them.

#### Accessing objects

Just like we need variables to access and use values, we need variables to access and reuse the objects that we create. Such variables that are used to access objects are called __reference variables__.

In the below code, we are creating three objects, each with its own reference variable

```
mob1=Mobile()
mob2=Mobile()
mob3=Mobile()
```

#### Look alike Object - Try out - Problem Statement

If two objects look the same and have the same values, can we treat it as a single object?

Each object is unique and independent of other object. Just like every person, including twins, are unique, so is every object.

All objects have an internal unique id (just like aadhar or green card number). We can check this using the inbuilt `id()`. The below code will display the unique number associated with the object.

```
class Mobile:
    pass

mob1=Mobile()
mob2=Mobile()

print(id(mob1))
print(id(mob2))
```

Output:
```
140317566712704
140317567051424
```

#### Attributes of an Object - Try out - Problem Statement

How can we create attributes and values for those attributes? __This can be done by using the . (dot) operator__. The syntax for creating attribute and value for that is as below:

`reference_variable.attribute_name=value`.

For example, in the below code we are creating two attributes price and brand, and assigning them to the two objects we had created.

We can access the attribute values using the dot operator itself. The syntax is as shown below:

`reference_variable.attribute_name`

In python, we can create attributes for a specific object alone. In the below example, the mob1 object has an ios version which mob2 does not have.

```
class Mobile:
    pass

mob1=Mobile()
mob2=Mobile()

mob1.price=20000
mob1.brand="Apple"
mob1.ios_version=10

mob2.price=3000
mob2.brand="Samsung"

print(mob1.price,mob1.brand,mob1.ios_version)
print(mob2.price,mob2.brand) 
                                                    
```

Output:
```
20000 Apple 10
3000 Samsung
```

#### Assigning vs Updating - Try out - Problem Statement

We can update the value of an existing attribute using the dot operator. For example, the below code will change the ios_version of mob1 object, since the mob1 object already has that attribute.

`mob1.ios_version=11`


In python, if we assign a value to a non-existent attribute, it will create that attribute for that object alone. For example, the below code will create an attribute for mob2 object alone.

`mob2.android_version="Marshmallow"`

```
class Mobile:
    pass

mob1=Mobile()
mob2=Mobile()

mob1.price=20000
mob1.brand="Apple"
mob1.ios_version=10

mob1.ios_version=11

mob2.price=3000
mob2.brand="Samsung"

mob2.android_version="Marshmallow"

print(mob1.ios_version)
print(mob2.android_version)                                                   
```

Output:
```
11
Marshmallow
```

#### Accessing a Non-Existing Attribute - Try out - Problem Statement
If we try to access a non-existing attribute, we will get an Attribute Error.

For example,

```
print(mob2.ios_version)
```

Output error:
```
Runtime Exception
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "file.py", line 15, in <module>
print(mob2.ios_version)
AttributeError: 'Mobile' object has no attribute 'ios_version'
```

## Variable vs Attribute

The rules for a class attribute are very similar to a variable. You just have to treat reference_variable.attribute_name as a variable.

![](images\7.PNG)

#### Best Practice - Try out - Problem Statement
Can you guess what will be the output of the below code? Will it give an error? If yes then why? If no, then why not?

> No error as attributes are created on the go for these two classes and hence both outputs are valid.

```
class Mobile:
    pass

mob1=Mobile()
mob2=Mobile()

mob1.price=20000
mob1.brand="Apple"
mob1.ios_version=11
print(mob1.ios_version)

mob2.price=3000
mob2.brand="Apple"
mob2.ios_versio=11
print(mob2.ios_versio)                                                    
```

Output:
```
11
11
```

#### Best Practice Contd. - Try out - Problem Statement
The below code will not give an error. However, mob2 will have an attribute ios_versio. This spelling mistake creates a new attribute! Hence be careful when assigning values to attributes of an object.

__The best practice is to ensure all objects of a class have the same set of attributes__. Very rarely should we create separate set of attributes for different objects. Also, languages like Java, C# etc do not allow us to create different set of attributes for different objects like python does.

```
class Mobile:
    pass

mob1=Mobile()
mob2=Mobile()

mob1.price=20000
mob1.brand="Apple"
mob1.ios_version=11
print(mob1.ios_version)

mob2.price=3000
mob2.brand="Apple"
mob2.ios_versio=11
print(mob2.ios_versio)
```

Output:

```
11
11
```

## Creating Common Attributes

We have already seen the problem arising out of human error in creating attributes individually for objects. Apart from this problem we also have to deal with the problem of lack of reuse. For example if an object has 10 attributes and we have 10 objects, then we have to write 100 lines of code! There is no reuse at all.

We need a way to mention the attributes of all the objects of a class in one place so that we can create and initialize the attributes. Let us see how to do this.

#### How do we create attributes in a class?

Attributes can be added to a class through a special function called `__init__()`. We will discuss more about the syntax later. But for now, this is how the mobile class will look like with attributes in it.

![](images\8.PNG)

In the code, brand and price are the attributes. All objects of this class will now have these attributes automatically. Here mob1 is assigned “Apple” and 20000 as values for the attributes brand and price respectively.

> __Note:__ The parameter names and attribute names need not match.


## Constructor & Self - Introduction

When we create an object, the special `__init__()` method inside the class of that object is invoked automatically. This special function is called as a __constructor__.

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Inside constructor")
mob1=Mobile()
```

__self__ is not a keyword. __self__ refers to the current object being executed.

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Id of self in constructor", id(self))
mob1=Mobile()

```

Output:
```
Id of self in constructor 2849445134144
```

#### Parameterless Constructor - Try out - Problem Statement
You can create a constructor without parameters. But this is rarely useful.

Run the below code and observe the output.

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Inside constructor")
        

mob1=Mobile()
mob2=Mobile()
```

Output:
```
Inside constructor
Inside constructor
```

#### Parameterized Constructor - Try out - Problem Statement
If a constructor takes parameters then it would be called as __parameterized constructor__.

Run the below code and observe the output.

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self, brand, price):
        print("Inside constructor")
        self.brand = brand
        self.price = price

mob1=Mobile("Apple", 20000)
print("Mobile 1 has brand", mob1.brand, "and price", mob1.price)

mob2=Mobile("Samsung",3000)
print("Mobile 2 has brand", mob2.brand, "and price", mob2.price)
```

Output:
```
Inside constructor
Mobile 1 has brand Apple and price 20000
Inside constructor
Mobile 2 has brand Samsung and price 3000
```

#### Parameterless & Parameterized Constructor - Try out - Problem Statement
If a constructor takes parameters and if we invoke it with a different number of parameters, the error message will indicate how many parameters were missed out or exceeded.

Run the below code and observe the output.

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self,one,two):
        print("Inside constructor")

mob1=Mobile()
```

Output:
```
Runtime Exception
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "file.py", line 7, in <module>
mob1=Mobile()
TypeError: __init__() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'one' and 'two'
```

Next code:

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self,one,two):
        print("Inside constructor")


mob1=Mobile(100,200,300)
```

Output:
```
Runtime Exception
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "file.py", line 6, in <module>
mob1=Mobile(100,200,300)
TypeError: __init__() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given
```

Observe here self is the first positional argument.

#### Attribute Creation Using self - Try out - Problem Statement
By using `self.attribute_name` and assigning a value we are creating attributes to the current object. __The best practice is to create attributes inside the constructor__.

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self, price, brand):
        print("Id of self in constructor", id(self))
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand

mob1=Mobile(1000, "Apple")
print("Id of mob1 in driver code", id(mob1))

mob2=Mobile(1000, "Apple")
print("Id of mob2 in driver code", id(mob2))
```

Output:
```
Id of self in constructor 140185599548288
Id of mob1 in driver code 140185599548288
Id of self in constructor 140185599757616
Id of mob2 in driver code 140185599757616
```

#### Attribute vs Local Variable - Try out - Problem Statement
Attributes can be created only by using the self variable and the dot operator. Without self we are only creating a local variable and not an attribute.

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self):
        print ("Inside the Mobile constructor")
        self.brand = None
        brand = "Apple" #This is a local variable.
        #Variables without self are local and they dont
        #affect the attributes.

        #Local varaibles cannot be accessed outside the init
        #Using self creates attributes which are
        #accessible in other methods as well

mob1=Mobile()
print(mob1.brand)#This does not print Apple
#This prints None because brand=Apple creates
#a local variable and it does not affect the attribute
```

Output:
```
Inside the Mobile constructor
None
```

#### Creating Behaviors - Try out - Problem Statement
We can create behavior in a class by adding functions in a class. However, such functions should have a special parameter called self as the first parameter. 

Such functions which describe the behavior are also called as methods. We can invoke the methods using the dot operator as shown.

Even though purchase() is accepting a parameter called self, we need not pass it when we invoke it.

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Inside constructor")

    def purchase (self):
        print("Purchasing a mobile")

mob1=Mobile()
mob1.purchase()
```

Output:
```
Inside constructor
Purchasing a mobile
```

#### Method Accessing Attributes - Try out - Problem Statement

We can access an attribute in a method by using self. Value of the attribute accessed inside the method is determined by the object used to invoke the method.

For example, in the code below when we invoke purchase using mob1, attribute values (Apple and 20000) of mob1 are accessed.

Similarly, when mob2 is used to invoke purchase, attribute values (Samsung and 3000) of mob2 are accessed in purchase().

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self, brand, price):
        print("Inside constructor")
        self.brand = brand
        self.price = price
        
    def purchase(self):
        print("Purchasing a mobile")
        print("This mobile has brand", self.brand, "and price", self.price)
        
print("Mobile-1")
mob1=Mobile("Apple", 20000)
mob1.purchase()

print("Mobile-2")
mob2=Mobile("Samsung",3000)
mob2.purchase()
```

Output:
```
Mobile-1
Inside constructor
Purchasing a mobile
This mobile has brand Apple and price 20000
Mobile-2
Inside constructor
Purchasing a mobile
This mobile has brand Samsung and price 3000
```

#### Invoking Methods - Try out - Problem Statement
We can also invoke one method from another using self.

For example:

```
class Mobile:
    def display(self):
        print("Displaying details")

    def purchase(self):
        self.display()
        print("Calculating price")

Mobile().purchase()
```

Output:
```
Displaying details
Calculating price
```

#### Identify Invoking Object - Try out - Problem Statement
In the below code, how does `return_product()` method know which mobile object we are using?

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self,price,brand):
        print ("Mobile created with id", id(self))
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand

    def return_product(self):
        print ("Mobile being returned has id", id(self))
        print ("Brand being returned is ",self.brand," and price is ",self.price)

mob1=Mobile(1000,"Apple")

mob2=Mobile(2000,"Samsung")

mob2.return_product()
```

`mob2.return_product()` can also be invoked as `Mobile.return_product(mob2)`.

Thus self now refers to mob2. For simplicity sake and for better readability we use `mob2.return_product()` instead of `Mobile.return_product(mob2)`. 

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self,price,brand):
        print (id(self))
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand

    def return_product(self):
        print (id(self))
        print ("Brand being returned is ",self.brand," and price is ",self.price)

mob1 = Mobile(1000, "Apple")
print ("Mobile 1 has id", id(mob1))

mob2=Mobile(2000, "Samsung")
print ("Mobile 2 has id", id(mob2))

mob2.return_product()
Mobile.return_product(mob2)
```

Output:

```
140021544422272
Mobile 1 has id 140021544422272
140021544632080
Mobile 2 has id 140021544632080
140021544632080
Brand being returned is Samsung and price is 2000
140021544632080
Brand being returned is Samsung and price is 2000
```

## Deep dive into self

![](images\9.PNG)

## Deep dive into methods

In python, everything is an object. Thus everything would have either attributes or behavior or both. That means even numbers, strings, list, set, dictionary, etc are all treated as objects in python. For example, 

![](images\10.PNG)

Difference between Function and Method:

![](images\11.PNG)



## Reference Variable

### Need for references
What happens to a balloon without the ribbon connecting it to the ground? Well, it escapes and becomes unusable.  
An object is like a balloon and the reference variable is like the ribbon connecting it to the ground.

![](images\12.PNG)

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self, price, brand):
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand

mob1=Mobile(1000, "Apple")
print(mob1.price)
#We are able to access the object
#in subsequent lines because we
#have a reference variable. This is
#like holding a balloon with a ribbon
```

```
Output:

1000
```

Just like a balloon without a ribbon, an object without a reference variable cannot be used later.

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self, price, brand):
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand

Mobile(1000, "Apple")
#After the above line the Mobile
# object created is lost and unusable
```

__No results obtained for the above code__


### Multiple references

Just like a balloon can have multiple ribbons, an object can also have multiple reference variables. Both the references are referring to the same object. When you assign an already created object to a variable, a new object is not created.

![](images\13.PNG)

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self, price, brand):
        print ("Inside constructor")
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand

mob1=Mobile(1000, "Apple")
mob2=mob1
print ("Id of object referred by mob1 reference variable is :", id(mob1))
print ("Id of object referred by mob2 reference variable is :", id(mob2))
#mob1 and mob2 are reference variables to the same object
```

Output:
```
Inside constructor
Id of object referred by mob1 reference variable is : 139672279321472
Id of object referred by mob2 reference variable is : 139672279321472
```

Let's say a balloon has three ribbons connecting it. If I change the color of the balloon tied to ribbon 1, what will be the color of the balloon tied to ribbons 2 and 3?

Just like the balloon with multiple ribbons, if we change the attribute of an object through one reference variable, it immediately reflects in other reference variable as there is only one balloon ultimately!

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self, price, brand):
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand

mob1=Mobile(1000, "Apple")
print("Price of mobile 1 :", mob1.price)

mob2=mob1
mob2.price=3000

print("Price of mobile 1 :", mob1.price)
print("Price of mobile 2 :", mob2.price)
```

Output:
```
Price of mobile 1 : 1000
Price of mobile 1 : 3000
Price of mobile 2 : 3000
```

### Dereferencing & Assigning

Can we take one of the multiple ribbons of balloon 1 and tie it to another balloon?  
What will happen to the first balloon? Will it be lost?

![](images\14.PNG)

Just like the balloons and ribbons, we can make one reference variable refer to another object. Now any change made through this reference variable will not affect the old object.

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self, price, brand):
        self.price = price
        self.brand = brand

mob1=Mobile(1000, "Apple")

mob2=mob1
mob2=Mobile(2000," Samsung")
mob2.price=3000

print("Mobile", "Id","Price")
print("mob1", id(mob1), mob1.price)
print("mob2", id(mob2), mob2.price)
```

Output:
```
Mobile Id Price
mob1 140432776248192 1000
mob2 140432776457616 3000
```

#### Reference variable summary

1. Reference variables hold the objects
2. We can create objects without reference variable as well
3. An object can have multiple reference variables
4. Assigning a new reference variable to an existing object does not create a new object

***

## OOPs Basics - Miscellaneous

### Printing an Object - Try out
What would be the output if we print the reference variable? Since it is an object, printing it will display the internal hex representation of it. How can we get a more readable output for this?

```
class Shoe:
    def __init__(self, price, material):
        self.price = price
        self.material = material

s1=Shoe(1000, "Canvas")
print(s1)
                                                    
```

Output:

```
<__main__.Shoe object at 0x7f82cd9dbb80>
```

### __str__ - Try out

For a more readable output when printing an object we can use the inbuilt special `__str__` method. This method MUST return a string and this string will be used when the object is printed. This is useful in debugging as we can print the values of the attributes.

```
class Shoe:
    def __init__(self, price, material):
        self.price = price
        self.material = material

    def __str__(self):
        return "Shoe with price: " + str(self.price) + " and material: " + self.material

s1=Shoe(1000, "Canvas")
print(s1)
                                                    
```

Output:
```
Shoe with price: 1000 and material: Canvas
```

### Coding Standards
All variable names and method names are in snake_case and all class names should be in PascalCase ( It is similar to camelCase but the first character is also Capitalized ). For example:

__Classes__:  
Mobile  
RegularCustomer  


__Methods__:  
change_password()  
display_details()  

__Variables__:   
price = 1000  
brand = "Samsung"
