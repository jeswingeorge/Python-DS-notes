Explanation :

Line 6 creates a Table object referred by dining_table.
Line 7 creates a Table object referred by back_table.
Line 8 creates a reference variable front_table referring to the object created in Line 7.
Line 9 changes the reference of back_table and makes it refer the object created in Line 6.
Thus at the end of Line 9, 3 reference variables and 2 objects are created.
Hence this is the answer.
Point to be noted: An object may be referred by more than one reference variables.

## 2a Prolem statement
A vehicle is identified by its mileage (in kms per litre) and fuel left (in litres) in the vehicle. From the fuel left, 5 litres will always be considered as reserve fuel. At any point of time, the driver of the vehicle may want to know:

- the maximum distance that can be covered without using the reserve fuel
- how many kms he/she has already travelled based on the initial fuel the vehicle had

Identify the class name and attributes so as to represent a vehicle from the information given.

- __init__()
- Vehicle
- Car
- identify_disctance_that_can_be_travelled()
- mileage
- fuel_left
- identify_distance_travelled(initial_fuel)

Write a Python program to implement the class chosen with its attributes and methods based on the requirements given below:

- __identify_distance_that_can_be_travelled()__: Return the distance that can be travelled by the vehicle without using the reserve fuel. If the fuel left is less than or equal to reserve fuel, the method should return 0.

- __identify_distance_travelled(initial_fuel)__: Return the distance so far travelled by the vehicle based on the initial fuel,fuel left and mileage.

Assume that initial fuel is always greater than fuel left.

Represent a vehicle and test your program by initializing the instance variables and invoking the appropriate methods.

Solution code by me:

```
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.mileage = None
        self.fuel_left = 5

    def identify_distance_that_can_be_travelled(self):
        if self.fuel_left > 5:
            distance = self.mileage * (self.fuel_left - 5)
            return(distance)
            # print("Distance(in km) that can be travelled without reserve fuel: ", distance)
        else:
            return(0)
        
    def identify_distance_travelled(self, initial_fuel):
        if initial_fuel>5:
            distance_travelled = self.mileage * (initial_fuel - self.fuel_left)
            # print("Distance that can be travelled: ",distance_travelled)
            return(distance_travelled)
        else:
            return(0)

```
