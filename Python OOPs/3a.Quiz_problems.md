## Assignment on Class Implementation
WeCare insurance company wants to calculate premium of vehicles.  

Vehicles are of two types â€“ "Two Wheeler" and "Four Wheeler". Each vehicle is identified by vehicle id, type, cost and premium amount.  

Premium amount is 2% of the vehicle cost for two wheelers and 6% of the vehicle cost for four wheelers. Calculate the premium amount and display the vehicle details.

Identify the class name and attributes to represent vehicles. 
- calculate_premium()
- vehicle_cost
- TwoWheeler
- vehicle_type
- vehicle_id
- Vehicle
- premium_amount
- FourWheeler
- premium_percentage
- calculate_vehicle_cost()
- `__init__()`
- display_vehicle_details()

Write a Python program to implement the class chosen with its attributes and methods.

Note:

1. Consider all instance variables to be private and methods to be public
2. Include getter and setter methods for all instance variables
3. Display appropriate error message, if the vehicle type is invalid
4. Perform case sensitive string comparison

Represent few objects of the class, initialize instance variables using setter methods, invoke appropriate methods and test your program.


#### Solution:
I have not added the excepption cases as its not covered yet.

```
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id, vehicle_type, vehicle_cost, vehicle_premium) -> None:
        self.__vehicle_id =  vehicle_id
        vehicle_type = input("Please enter vehicle type details:\n 1 -  TwoWheeler \n 2 - FourWheeler\n\n")
        if vehicle_type=='1':
            self.__vehicle_type = 'Two Wheeler'
        elif vehicle_type=='2':
            self.__vehicle_type = 'Four Wheeler'
        else:
            print("Invalid Entry - Please enter 1 for TwoWheeler and 2 for FourWheeler")

        self.__vehicle_cost = vehicle_cost
        self.__vehicle_premium = vehicle_premium

    def get_vehicle_id(self):
        return self.__vehicle_id
    
    def get_vehicle_type(self):
        return self.__vehicle_type

    def get_vehicle_cost(self):
        return self.__vehicle_cost   

    def get_vehicle_premium(self):
        return self.__vehicle_premium   

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return "Vehicle id is {}. Vehicle type is {}. Vehicle cost is {}. Vehicle premium percentage is {}%.".format(self.get_vehicle_id(),
                self.get_vehicle_type(), self.get_vehicle_cost(), self.get_vehicle_premium())
    
    def display_vehicle_details(self):
        print("Vehicle id is {}.\nVehicle type is {}.\nVehicle cost is {}.\nVehicle premium percentage is {}%.".format(self.get_vehicle_id(),
                self.get_vehicle_type(), self.get_vehicle_cost(), self.get_vehicle_premium()))
    
    def calculate_premium(self):
        if self.get_vehicle_type()=='Two Wheeler':
            premium_cost = self.get_vehicle_cost() + (self.get_vehicle_cost()*0.02)
        else:
            premium_cost = self.get_vehicle_cost() + (self.get_vehicle_cost()*0.06)

        print("Premium cost for this vehicle is: ",premium_cost)



v1= Vehicle(123, 1, 2000, 2)
# print(v1)
v1.display_vehicle_details()
v1.calculate_premium()
```

## Assignment on Class Implementation - Level 2

echWorld, a technology training center, wants to allocate courses for instructors.
An instructor is identified by name, technology skills, experience and average feedback.
An instructor is allocated a course, if he/she satisfies the below two conditions:

- eligibility criteria:
    - if experience is more than 3 years, average feedback should be 4.5 or more
    - if experience is 3 years or less, average feedback should be 4 or more

- he/she should posses the technology skill for the course

Identify the class name and attributes from the list of options below to represent instructors.

- check_eligibility()
- avg_feedback
- experience
- instructor_name
- allocate_course()
- allocate_course(technolody)
= `__init__()`
- Instructor
- calculate_avg_feedback()
- technology_skill

Write a Python program to implement the class chosen with its attributes and methods.

Note:

1. Consider all instance variables to be private and methods to be public
2. An instructor may have multiple technology skills, so consider instance variable, technology_skill to be a list
3. `check_eligibility()`: Return true if eligibility criteria is satisfied by the instructor. Else, return false
4. `allocate_course(technology)`: Return true if the course which requires the given technology can be allocated to the instructor. Else, return false
5. Perform case sensitive string comparison

Represent few objects of the class, initialize instance variables using setter methods, invoke appropriate methods and test your program.
