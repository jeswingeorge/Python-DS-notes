# Abstarction

Consider the below code:

```
class Mobile:
    def __init__(self, brand, price):
        print("Inside constructor")
        self.brand = brand
        self.price = price
    def purchase(self):
        print("Purchasing a mobile")
        print("This mobile has brand", self.brand, "and price", self.price)

print("Mobile-1")
mob1=Mobile("Apple", 20000)
mob1.purchase()
print("Mobile-2")
mob2=Mobile("Samsung",3000)
mob2.purchase()
```

When we invoke the purchase() on a mobile object, we don’t have to know the details of the method to invoke it.  This ability to use something without having to know the details of how it is working is called as __abstraction__.

# Need for encapsulation

Consider the below code where the customer has a wallet_balance and there are methods which allow us to access and update that balance based on some logic.
Just the way a lock prevents others from accessing your property, we can restrict other parts of the code from directly accessing sensitive data.

```
class Customer:
    def __init__(self, cust_id, name, age, wallet_balance):
        self.cust_id = cust_id
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.wallet_balance = wallet_balance

    def update_balance(self,amount):
        if amount < 1000 and amount > 0:
            self.wallet_balance += amount

    def show_balance(self):
            print("The balance is ",self.wallet_balance)

c1=Customer(100, "Gopal", 24, 1000)
c1.update_balance(500)
c1.show_balance()
                                                    
```

Output:
```
The balance is 1500
```

#### Public data access

But with the way currently it is coded, the data can be accidentally changed by directly assigning a incorrect value to it as shown below:

```
class Customer:
    def __init__(self, cust_id, name, age, wallet_balance):
        self.cust_id = cust_id
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.wallet_balance = wallet_balance

    def update_balance(self, amount):
        if amount < 1000 and amount > 0:
            self.wallet_balance += amount

    def show_balance(self):
        print ("The balance is ",self.wallet_balance)

c1=Customer(100, "Gopal", 24, 1000)
c1.wallet_balance = 10000000000

c1.show_balance()

```

Output:

The balance is 10000000000

#### Private Data Access

We can put a lock on that data by adding a double underscore in front of it, as shown in below code.

Adding a double underscore makes the attribute a private attribute. Private attributes are those which are accessible only inside the class. This method of restricting access to our data is called __encapsulation__.

```
class Customer:
    def __init__(self, cust_id, name, age, wallet_balance):
        self.cust_id = cust_id
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.__wallet_balance = wallet_balance

    def update_balance(self, amount):
        if amount < 1000 and amount > 0:
            self.__wallet_balance += amount

    def show_balance(self):
        print ("The balance is ",self.__wallet_balance)

c1=Customer(100, "Gopal", 24, 1000)
print(c1.__wallet_balance)
```

#### How does encapsulation work? 

When we put a double underscore in front of the attribute name, python will internally change its name to `_Classname__attribute`.

This is why we get an error when we try to access a private attribute.

#### Private Data Update - Caution !

If we try to assign a value to a private variable, we end up creating a new attribute in python. Thus this code does not give an error, but it is logically flawed and does not produce the intended result.

```
class Customer:
    def __init__(self, cust_id, name, age, wallet_balance):
        self.cust_id = cust_id
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.__wallet_balance = wallet_balance

    def update_balance(self, amount):
        if amount < 1000 and amount > 0:
            self.__wallet_balance += amount

    def show_balance(self):
        print ("The balance is ",self.__wallet_balance)

c1=Customer(100, "Gopal", 24, 1000)
c1.__wallet_balance = 10000000000
c1.show_balance()
```

#### Accessing Private Variables

Since we know that the name of the variable changes when we make it private, we can access it using its modified name as shown in below code.

So, if private variable can be accessed outside the class and can be modified, then what is the advantage of making it private?

__Note__: Languages like Java, C#, etc do not allow access of private variable outside the class

```
class Customer:
    def __init__(self, cust_id, name, age,wallet_balance):
        self.cust_id = cust_id
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.__wallet_balance = wallet_balance

    def update_balance(self, amount):
        if amount < 1000 and amount> 0:
            self.__wallet_balance += amount

    def show_balance(self):
        print ("The balance is ",self.__wallet_balance)

c1=Customer(100, "Gopal", 24, 1000)
c1._Customer__wallet_balance = 10000000000
c1.show_balance()

```

Output:

The balance is 10000000000

#### Encapsulation - Just a Caution Sign

Any lock can be broken by a determined thief. Similarly, just because you make your code private, does not mean it is not accessible to other developers. When a developer sees a private variable, it’s a gentleman's agreement not to access it directly. It is used to only prevent accidental access.

Thus in python encapsulation is more like a caution sign than a lock. A caution sign is there so that you don’t accidentally break a rule. But if you still want to break it you can, with consequence.

### Getters & Setters

To have a error free way of accessing and updating private variables, we create specific methods for this.

- The methods which are meant to set a value to a private variable are called __setter methods__
- The methods meant to access private variable values are called __getter methods__

The below code is an example of getter and setter methods:

```
class Customer:
    def __init__(self, id, name, age, wallet_balance):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.__wallet_balance = wallet_balance

    def set_wallet_balance(self, amount):
        if amount < 1000 and amount > 0:
            self.__wallet_balance = amount

    def get_wallet_balance(self):
        return self.__wallet_balance

c1=Customer(100, "Gopal", 24, 1000)
c1.set_wallet_balance(120)
print(c1.get_wallet_balance())
```

Output:

120

### Class diagram
A lot of things can go wrong in communication.

To ensure that programmers all over understand each other properly, we need a common way of representing a class. This is called as a class diagram. This is similar to a circuit diagram or a plan or machine diagram which allows engineers to understand each others' ideas clearly.

Unlike the complex engineering diagrams, a class diagram is quite simple. It has four parts: 
- the name of the class
- the list of attributes
- the list of methods and,
- access specifiers.

![](images\19.PNG)

In a class diagram, a __–__ sign indicates private access and __+__ indicates public access.

__Note:__ We can create private methods by adding a double underscore in front of it, just like private variables. Also, if a method has both leading and trailing double underscores ( like `__init__`, `__str__`, etc) it indicates that it is a special built-in method. As per coding convention, we are not supposed to create our own methods with both leading and trailing underscores.

## Getters & Setters - Way to Code !

All __setter methods__ must accept the value to be updated as a parameter and all __getter methods__ must not have any parameter and they must return the value.

Setter methods are called as __mutator methods__ ( as they change or mutate the value ) and the getter methods are called __accessor methods__ ( as they access the values ).

```
class Customer:
    def __init__(self, id, name, age, wallet_balance):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.__wallet_balance = wallet_balance
    def set_wallet_balance(self, amount):
        if amount < 1000 and amount>  0:
            self.__wallet_balance = amount
    def get_wallet_balance(self):
        return self.__wallet_balance
c1=Customer(100, "Gopal", 24, 1000)
c1.set_wallet_balance(120)
print(c1.get_wallet_balance())

```
