# Introduction
In Programming fundamentals you have been coding in Python using procedural oriented programming, and are familiar with its syntax. You have written small programs using functions. What if you have to write a real world complex application like an online shopping app? How would you go about doing it and where will you start?

In this course, you are going to learn how to build complex real world applications using a technique known as object oriented programming. We will be using an online shopping scenario to understand OOP concepts.

__Online Purchase - A Scenario: Problem Statement__   
Consider the below code which allows you to purchase different products. All products have discount of 10%.

Run the below code and observe the output.

```
def purchase_product(product_type, price):
    discount = 10
    total_price = price - price * discount / 100
    print("Total price of " +product_type+ " is "+str(total_price))

purchase_product("Mobile", 20000)
purchase_product("Shoe", 200)
```

Output:
```
Total price of Mobile is 18000.0
Total price of Shoe is 180.0
```

__Changing Requirements - Try out: Problem Statement__  
Let us say that we want to update our code such that:
- if the mobile brand is Apple then the discount is 10% else the discount is 5%
- all shoes have 2% tax and no discount
We can accomplish this by adding additional parameters to the function and updating the logic.

Run the below code and observe the output.

```
def purchase_product(product_type, price, mobile_brand = None):
    if product_type == "Mobile":
        if mobile_brand == "Apple":
            discount = 10
        else:
            discount = 5
        total_price = price - price * discount / 100
    else:
        total_price = price + price * 2 / 100

    print("Total price of " +product_type+ " is "+str(total_price))

purchase_product("Mobile", 20000, "Apple")
purchase_product("Shoe", 200)
                                                
```

Output:
```
Total price of Mobile is 18000.0
Total price of Shoe is 204.0
```

__Increasing Problems - Try out: Problem Statement__

The solution we came up with has a key problem. Data for mobiles and shoes are mixed up in the same code. If we have to make changes to the logic for purchasing shoes, we have to modify method that has logic for both shoes and mobiles. For example, if we have to add 'material' to the shoe and have a 5% tax on 'leather' shoes, then we have to go through code related to mobile as well, as shown below:

```
def purchase_product(product_type,price,mobile_brand,material):
    if product_type == "Mobile":
        if mobile_brand == "Apple":
            discount = 10
        else:
            discount = 5
        total_price = price - price * discount / 100
    else:
        if material == "leather":
            tax = 5
        else:
            tax = 2
        total_price = price + price * tax / 100
    print("Total price of "+product_type+" is "+str(total_price))

purchase_product("Mobile",20000,"Apple",None)
purchase_product("Shoe",200,None,"leather")                                                    
```

Output:
```
Total price of Mobile is 18000.0
Total price of Shoe is 210.0
```

__Modular Programming - The Problem Statement__

A better solution would be to modularize the code and separate the logic for Mobiles and Shoes.

Modify the code in the above code pane as per the following guidelines:

- Create two functions: purchase_mobile and purchase_shoe
- `purchase_mobile()` takes two parameters: price and brand
- `purchase_shoe()` takes two parameters: price and material
- If the mobile brand is “Apple”, discount is 10%, else discount is 5%
- If the shoe material is “leather”, tax is 5%, else tax is 2%


```
def purchase_mobile(price,mobile_brand):
    if mobile_brand == "Apple":
            discount = 10
    else:
        discount = 5
    
    total_price = price - price * discount / 100
    print("Total price of "+ 'mobile' +" is "+str(total_price))

def purchase_shoe(price, material):
    if material == "leather":
        tax = 5
    else:
        tax = 2
    
    total_price = price + price * tax / 100
    print("Total price of "+ 'shoe' +" is "+str(total_price))

purchase_mobile(20000,"Apple")
purchase_shoe(100,'leather')
```

Output:
```
Total price of mobile is 18000.0
Total price of shoe is 105.0
```

__Increasing Requirements: Display Refund Amount: Problem Statement__
We want to provide users with facility to return products as well. During return, refund amount should be displayed.


How do we go about displaying the refund amount? One way is to recalculate the price as shown below. Here, price calculation logic is repeated in purchase as well as in return functions. This obviously is a bad idea.

```
def return_mobile(price, brand):
    if brand == "Apple":
        discount = 10
    else:
        discount = 5
    total_price = price - price * discount / 100

    print("Refund price for Mobile is "+str(total_price))

def return_shoe(price, material):
    if material == "leather":
        tax = 5
    else:
        tax = 2
    total_price = price + price * tax  /100

    print("Refund price for Shoe is "+str(total_price))

return_mobile(1000, "Samsung")
```

Output:
```
Refund price for Mobile is 950.0
```

Alternatively we can use global variables. We calculate the price during purchase and store it in a global variable. Later during return we access the calculated price from the global variable. But this brings more complications than it tries to solve.

```
total_price_mobile = 0
total_price_shoe = 0
def purchase_mobile(price,brand):
    global total_price_mobile
    if brand == "Apple":
        discount = 10
    else:
        discount = 5
    total_price_mobile = price - price * discount / 100
    print("Total price for Mobile is "+str(total_price_mobile))

def purchase_shoe(price,material):
    global total_price_shoe
    if material == "leather":
        tax = 5
    else:
        tax = 2
    total_price_shoe = price + price * tax / 100
    print("Total price for Shoe is "+str(total_price_shoe))

def return_mobile():
    print("Refund price for Mobile is ",total_price_mobile)

def return_shoe():
    print("Refund price for Shoe is ",total_price_shoe)

purchase_mobile(20000,"Apple")
purchase_shoe(200,"leather")
return_mobile()                                                    
```

Output:
```
Total price for Mobile is 18000.0
Total price for Shoe is 210.0
Refund price for Mobile is 18000.0
```

What if we want to purchase two mobiles and return one of them? Which will be returned? Also, can we be sure that `purchase_shoe()` won't accidentally modify the global value for mobile?

## OOP Introduction - Summary

We can see that with our current style of programming, we quickly run into complications trying to simulate real world scenarios, like purchasing and returning a product.

The problem arises due to the fact that in real life everything has some data/characteristic associated with it and some behavior associated with it and we are not able to replicate this in a code. For example:

- All mobiles have price and brand as its data and purchase and return as its behavior.
- All shoes have price and material as its data and purchase and return as its behavior.

We need a way of programming which allows to club together the data and behavior so that it becomes easier to code real world scenarios.

### OOP Approach

#### 1. Clubbing data and behavior

Object oriented programming approach allows us to club together the data and behavior so that it becomes easier to code real world scenarios.

Consider the following example, where Mobile and Shoe clubs characteristics as data & purchase(), return() as it's behavior.

#### 2. Templating

Once we have a template of the data and the related behavior we can use that template to create many copies.

#### 3. Object oriented programming

This style of programming where we create a template and create copies from that template is called object oriented programming. This style allows us to code for scenarios closely linked with real life.

The template we create is called a Class and the copies we create out of it is called an object.
